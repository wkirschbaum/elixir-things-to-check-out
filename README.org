My personal list of elixir projects I want to experiment with.

   Surface is a server-side rendering component library that allows
   developers to build rich interactive user-interfaces, writing
   minimal custom Javascript.

* Data Messaging

   Concurrent and multi-stage data ingestion and data processing
